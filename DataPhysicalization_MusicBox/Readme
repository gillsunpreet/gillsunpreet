Data Physicalization Music Box

This project uses a rotary encoder to select a decade (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) and plays a random song from that decade using Python and Arduino. The LED intensity represents the popularity of different genres over time.

Project Structure:
- DataPhysicalization_MusicBox/
  - ArduinoCodeEncoder/  -> Arduino code for rotary encoder and LED control
  - CSVFiles_SongData/   -> Song data collected from Billboard, YouTube, and Waterloo studies
  - DemoVideo/           -> Video demonstration of the project
  - GetDateFromTables/   -> Pre-run script to extract required data from tables
  - PlayRandomMusicPython/ -> Python script to play music based on selected decade

How It Works:
1. The user rotates the rotary encoder, which maps the position to a decade (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s).
2. The LED brightness levels represent genre popularity trends for the selected decade.
3. When the encoder button is pressed, it sends the decade name to Python over serial communication.
4. The Python script randomly selects and plays a song from the corresponding folder.

Setup Instructions:
1. Install Python Dependencies:
   pip install pygame pyserial

2. Upload the Arduino Code:
   - Connect the rotary encoder to the Arduino (Pins 2, 3, 4).
   - Connect LEDs to pins 9, 10, 11, and 12.
   - Upload the ArduinoCodeEncoder.ino file using Arduino IDE.

3. Run the Python Script:
   python play_random_music.py

Troubleshooting:
- If the rotary encoder doesn't respond, check wiring and ensure the correct COM port is used in Python.
- If no music plays, verify the folder paths in the Python script contain MP3 files.
- You can either create folders with music data using the provided data or use the existing songs folder.
